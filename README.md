## Overview

### Challenge

The challenge was to create a multi-step form that allows users to complete each step, go back to a previous step, see a summary of their selections on the final step, and confirm their order. Users should also be able to view the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size and see hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page. Additionally, form validation messages should be displayed if any field has been missed or if the email address is not correctly formatted.
